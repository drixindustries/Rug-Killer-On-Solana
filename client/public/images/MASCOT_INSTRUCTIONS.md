# Rug Killer Mascot Setup

## Instructions
Save the mascot image (the evil smiley character with orange/coral glow and dashboard elements) as:

**Filename**: `rug-killer-mascot.png`

**Location**: `/client/public/images/rug-killer-mascot.png`

## Image Specifications
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Recommended size: 1000x1000px or larger
- The image will be displayed at 500x500px
- Opacity: 15% (automatically applied via CSS)
- Position: Bottom left corner, slightly off-screen (-5% left, -5% bottom)
- Effect: Subtle blur + floating animation

## Current Implementation
The mascot has been integrated into:
- ✅ Main home page (`/`)
- ✅ Landing page (`/landing`)
- ✅ CSS animations (gentle floating effect)
- ✅ Positioned to not overpower content

## How to Add Image
1. Save the mascot image you provided as `rug-killer-mascot.png`

3. The CSS will automatically apply the faded, floating effect

The image will appear faded in the bottom left corner with a gentle floating animation!
